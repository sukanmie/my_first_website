    Although the phrase is nonsense, it does have a long history. The phrase has been used for several centuries by typographers to show the most distinctive features of their fonts.

          <em>of a passage from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum,</em><br>
          <strong> a treatise on the theory of ethics written by Cicero in 45 B.C.</strong>

            "Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit ...,"
             which translates as, "There is no one who loves pain itself,
              who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain..."
